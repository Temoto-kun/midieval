# midieval
Simple application analyzing common patterns and note consonance in MIDI files.

## About
**MIDIEval** (read *mee-dee-EE-vahl*) produces visualizations based on pattern recognition and pitch analysis among MIDI notes. The application accepts two sets of MIDI files for comparison and outputs aggregate statistics for each set, including "harmonicity" -- a measure of consonance/dissonance between notes of a progression/chord, as well as graphs for common structural (i.e. melodic) patterns.

## Requirements
MIDIEval runs on .NET Framework 4 (see [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8z6watww%28v=vs.100%29.aspx](System Requirements)).

## License
MIDIEval is licensed under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for more details.
